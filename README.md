# Dailysales_excel-Dashbord
In this project, I performed a Superstore sales analysis, by evaluating the daily sales data to understand the top 10 states as per sales and top 10 sub-categories as per sales and find out the daily sales by determining the various factors.
I used Microsoft Excel to carry out this analysis, which involves data cleaning and Transforming the data as required - creating pivot tables and dashboard building.
In Excel - Working sheet - The yellow color Column is transforming data.
The "Order" Sheet is Master Data.
