Overview :- 
Today, I have created an Excel Dashboard to analyze the daily sales and profits of Superstore, along with some fascinating insights. This dashboard provides an interactive and visual representation of the data, allowing users to identify trends and make data-driven decisions. The dashboard focuses on finding out the top 10 American states and top 10 subcategories as per sales, both using calendar dates (day, month, year) and ship mode and categories.

Additionally, the dashboard provides total sales and average sales and profits with daily trends using a combo chart, where profits are shown as a line graph with marks, and sales are displayed with clustered columns.

Features :- 

•	Top 10 American States by Sales: A bar chart displays the top 10 American states based on their total sales. Users can easily identify which states generate the highest revenue for the Superstore.

•	Top 10 Subcategories by Sales: A bar chart shows the top 10 subcategories based on their total sales. This information helps in understanding which product categories are most popular among customers.

•	Sales Analysis by Calendar Date: The dashboard provides interactive date filters to analyze sales and profits based on specific calendar dates, such as day, month, and year.

•	Sales Analysis by Ship Mode and Categories: Users can analyze sales performance based on different ship modes and product categories using interactive filters.

•	Combo Chart for Daily Trends: A combo chart shows the daily trends of both profits (represented as a line graph with marks) and sales (displayed with clustered columns). This chart allows users to spot trends and patterns over time.
